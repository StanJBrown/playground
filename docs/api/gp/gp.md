Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary algorithm-based methodology
inspired by biological evolution to find computer programs that perform a
user-defined task. Essentially GP is a set of instructions and a fitness
function to measure how well a computer has performed a task. It is a
specialization of genetic algorithms (GA) where each individual is a computer
program. It is a machine learning technique used to optimize a population of
computer programs according to a fitness landscape determined by a program's
ability to perform a given computational task.

There are two implementations of GP:
- **Tree based**
    - tree
    - crossover
    - editor
    - evaluation
    - evaluation_2
    - generator
    - mutation
    - parser
- **Cartesian based**
    - cartesian
    - cartesian_evaluator
    - cartesian_generator
    - cartesian_mutation
