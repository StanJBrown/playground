# Genetic Programming - Mutation
The following are mutation methods supported by playground.

- Point mutation
- Hoist mutation
- Sub-tree mutation
- Shrink mutation
- Expand mutation


# Point Mutation
Among the simplest mutation methods, it selects a random node in the GP tree,
the node then undergoes a mutation. If the node selected is a terminal node it
would mutate into another terminal node. Otherwise if the node selected is a
function node it would only mutate to another function node of the same arity
(same number of input arguments).
