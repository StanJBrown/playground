Genetic Algorithms is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural
selection. This heuristic (also sometimes called a metaheuristic) is routinely
used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems. Genetic
algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA), which
generate solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by
natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.

The Genetic Algorithm module contains a bit string implementation in
sub-modules:

- bit_string
- bit_string.generator
- bit_string.crossover
- bit_string.mutation
