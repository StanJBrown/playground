# playground.climbing
Hill climbing algorithms belong to a family of _local search_. It is an
iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then
attempts to find a better solution by incrementally changing a single element
of the solution. If the change produces a better solution, the change is kept
until no further improvements can be found.

`climbers` sub-module contains the hill climbing algorithms.
