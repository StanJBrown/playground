# TODO

- Generation record (with Database?)
    Preferably with PostgreSQL. Things to record are:
        - population
            - size
            - generation number
            - best score
            - best individual
        - individuals
            - score
            - size
            - depth
            - branches
            - tree structure in post-order format
        - selection
            - method
            - selected
        - crossover
            - method
            - probability
        - mutation
            - method
            - probability

- Add 2 more symbolic regression examples
- Add ability to seed random
- Look at Cartesian GP
- Look at Co-evolution and how to implement it

---

- Cache sub tree scores:
    more complicated than once thought

- Enable playground to become a dedicated evaluator

Refactoring:
    - Tree generator
    - Tree node generator
    - GP stuff into its rightful place
    - Refactor config, instead of "input_nodes" use "input_variables"
